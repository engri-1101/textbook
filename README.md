ENGRI 1101 Labs
===============

**NOTE:** This repo was transferred from
[Cornell's GitHub](https://github.coecis.cornell.edu) in July 2022. For more
details on the transfer, see [bfg_report](bfg_report).

This repo serves as the standard for ENGRI 1101 lab software / files.
[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project/5ecf1b879f37710001f9f54d) serves as
the standard for pre-lab/lab handouts. Archives of distribution files
(including both pre-lab and lab handouts) can be found on
[box](https://cornell.box.com/s/t3f8yntntr8z265decbkjzhz2fdbd6t9).
The archive currently includes the Fall 2020 and Spring 2022 semesters. If you
need access to this archive, please email Ricky (rls499@cornell.edu).

## GitHub Large File Storage

This repository currently has source files that are larger than the 100MB
file size limit. In order to version control these files, we use
[GitHub Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com). You will need to have
this tool installed before cloning the repository. On macOS, the recommended
way to do this is using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), a package manager for
macOS. If you do not have it installed, see the installation instructions
[here](https://brew.sh). After installing, install LFS with this command.

```
brew install git-lfs
git lfs install
```

For Windows installation instructions or to install on macOS
*without Homebrew*, see these
[instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage).

## Installation

See [GitHub Large File Storage](#GitHub-Large-File-Storage) before cloning.
To clone the repo and create distribution files for the latest versions of
these labs, run the following commands. Be aware this takes a moment.

```
git clone git@github.com:engri-1101/textbook.git
cd labs
make all
```

This will create a distribution file called `<lab_name>_lab.zip` within each
lab directory. Note that this distribution file does not include any
pre-lab or lab handouts.

## Development

See [GitHub Large File Storage](#GitHub-Large-File-Storage) before cloning.
To work on developing these labs, you will need to run an additional command
after cloning the repository. If you are new to using Git, see the
[Git Tutorial](tutorials/git/git.md).

```
git clone git@github.com:engri-1101/textbook.git
git config --local include.path ../.gitconfig
```

Here, the last command configures git to filter out Jupyter Notebook output and
metadata. This makes version control of Jupyter Notebooks more pleasant. See
the labs [README](labs/README.md) for instructions on creating a new lab.

## Directory Structure

- [labs](labs) contains all lab directories and a [README](labs/README.md)
  summarizing how to build labs, lab directory structure, and a list of labs.
- [software_install](software_install) contains software installation
  instructions and a notebook to test the installation.
- [tutorials](tutorials) contains tutorials for OR-Tools (aimed at teaching
  assistants who come from an AMPL background).
- [lp_models_and_examples](lp_models_and_examples) contains a large selection
  of example LP and IP models written in OR-Tools.
- [lp_package_testing](lp_package_testing) contains analysis of potential
  Python-based LP packages (Summer 2020).
- [gilp_lab_submissions](gilp_lab_submissions) contains parsed student lab
  submissions (Fall 2020) for labs using the `gilp` python package.
