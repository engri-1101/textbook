ENGRI 1101 Labs
===============

**NOTE:** This repo was transferred from
[Cornell's GitHub](https://github.coecis.cornell.edu) in July 2022. For more
details on the transfer, see [bfg_report](bfg_report).

This repo serves as the standard for ENGRI 1101 lab software / files.
[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project/5ecf1b879f37710001f9f54d) serves as
the standard for pre-lab/lab handouts. Archives of distribution files
(including both pre-lab and lab handouts) can be found on
[box](https://cornell.box.com/s/t3f8yntntr8z265decbkjzhz2fdbd6t9).
The archive currently includes the Fall 2020 and Spring 2022 semesters. If you
need access to this archive, please email Ricky (rls499@cornell.edu).

## Installation

To clone the repo and create distribution files for the latest versions of
these labs, run the following commands. Be aware this takes a moment.

```
git clone git@github.com:engri-1101/textbook.git
cd engri-1101-labs/labs
make all
```

This will create a distribution file called `<lab_name>_lab.zip` within each
lab directory. Note that this distribution file does not include any
pre-lab or lab handouts.

## Development

To work on developing these labs, you will need to run an additional command
after cloning the repository. If you are new to using Git, see the
[Git Tutorial](tutorials/git/git.md).

```
git clone git@github.com:engri-1101/textbook.git
cd engri-1101-labs
git config --local include.path ../.gitconfig
```

Here, the last command configures git to filter out Jupyter Notebook output and
metadata. This makes version control of Jupyter Notebooks more pleasant. See
the labs [README](labs/README.md) for instructions on creating a new lab.

## Directory Structure

- [labs](labs) contains all lab directories and a [README](labs/README.md)
  summarizing how to build labs, lab directory structure, and a list of labs.
- [software_install](software_install) contains software installation
  instructions and a notebook to test the installation.
- [tutorials](tutorials) contains tutorials for OR-Tools (aimed at teaching
  assistants who come from an AMPL background).
- [lp_models_and_examples](lp_models_and_examples) contains a large selection
  of example LP and IP models written in OR-Tools.
- [lp_package_testing](lp_package_testing) contains analysis of potential
  Python-based LP packages (Summer 2020).
- [gilp_lab_submissions](gilp_lab_submissions) contains parsed student lab
  submissions (Fall 2020) for labs using the `gilp` python package.

## Textbook Development

In your engri_1101 conda environment, `pip install jupyter-book` and `pip install ghp-import`.

Common commands
- Make: see Makefile
  - For Window users, install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install#individual) then `choco install make` to set up
- Jupyter-Book: in the `src` folder, `jupyter-book build .` and `jupyter-book clean .`
- GitHub Pages: from this branch (textbook), `ghp-import -n -p -f _build/html` to publish to the gh-pages branch and web

Structure
- Each "handout" is split into sections that each have their own notebook
- Edits go in `<section_name>_master.ipynb` files
  - The other versions are generated by the Makefile
- Cell tags are used to control which cells display
  - In Jupyter Notebook, View > Cell Toolbar > Tags

Tags
- **remove-cell**: will not appear or run on web but still there in underlying notebook, other built-in tags [here](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/interactive/hiding.html)
- **non-web**: will be deleted in `<section_name>_web.ipynb` files, for less web-friendly more notebook-friendly formatting or answers usually
- **web-only**: will be deleted in `<lab_name>_lab_key.ipynb` and `<lab_name>_lab.ipynb`, for more web-friendly less notebook-friendly formatting
- **key-only**: will be deleted in `<lab_name>_lab.ipynb`, for cases where the answer isnâ€™t blue text
