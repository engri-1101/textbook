This algorithm will take a given feasible flow $f$ and either finds a new feasible flow of greater value or else proves that the current flow is optimal. The key element of this algorithm is something called the *residual graph*, which is constructed anew for each current feasible flow $f$."

    "The arcs added in step 2 are called *forward arcs* since they correspond to moving the flow forward on real arcs of the input; on the other hand, the arcs added in step 3 are called *backward arcs* since flow moving on one of these corresponds to flow moving backwards on an arc of the input.\n",

    "If there is a path from $s$ to $t$ in $G_f$, then $f$ is not optimal; we will indicate in the algorithm how this path can be used to generate a better feasible flow.\n",

    "If there is no path from $s$ to $t$ in $G_f$, let $S$ be the set of nodes in $V$ for which there is a path from $s$ (and $T$ corresponds to the restof the nodes, $V\\setminus S$). Then we claim that $(S,T)$ is a cut of capacity equal to the value of flow $f$. We next show why this is true. First, we know that for each arc $(v,w) \\in D(S,T)$, it must be the case that $f(v,w)=u(v,w)$. The reason for this is easy: if $f(v,w)$ was less than $u(v,w)$, then $(v,w)$ would be an arc in the residual graph; if $v \\in S$, then there is a path from $s$ to $v$ in $G_f$, so there must be a path from $s$ to $w$ in $G_f$ too, making $w \\in S$. But this is a contradiction, and hence $f(v,w)=u(v,w)$. Similarly, it must be the case that for each arc $(w,v)$ such that $w \\in T$ and $v \\in S$, $f(w,v)=0$. Otherwise, there would be a backwards arc $(v,w)$ in $G_f$, and since $v \\in S$, $w$ must be in $S$ too, which is a contradiction. The capacity of the cut is therefore equal to the total flow from nodes in $S$ to nodes in $T$ minus the  total flow from nodes in $T$ to nodes in $S$. The only place that flow \"can end up\" is the sink, and thus we can argue that the previous quantity is just the value of this flow $f$. The capacity of the cut $(S,T)$ is equal to the value of the flow $f$.\n",

There is a simple fix for this; the flow in which each arc has flow value equal to 0 is feasible, so we can always start with this one. Then we can apply the algorithm given above until we have a feasible flow that cannot be improved, which is a maximum flow.\n",

    "There is one final observation that should be made about the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. Suppose that the input has capacities that are all integers; i.e., $u(v,w)$ is an integer, for each $(v,w) \\in E$. Then it is easy to see that the algorithm always produces an optimal solution in which each flow value $f(v,w)$ is also an integer. This property is *very* important and is called the *integrality property*. \n",
