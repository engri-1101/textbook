    "# Solving a Problem -- Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us return to the definition of operations research given in the previous handout. One aspect that we did not touch upon is that we require the mathematical model be *analyzed*, so it can provide guidance in the given decision-making setting. For an optimization model, the element is thereby an algorithm, a computation procedure that can solve the task at hand. And just as we have described a generic computational task, there should also be a generic procedure that can handle all possible inputs. One can think of this as a sufficiently robust software package that can handle any of the inputs you might \"reasonably\" want to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the traveling salesman problem, there is a quite simple algorithm that is guaranteed to produce an optimal solution. One might \"simply\" enumerate all possible permutations, one after the other, evaluate the cost associated with each permutation, and then output the permutation with the cheapest cost. This certainly works correctly for any input. So are we done? Actually, no. The problem is that there are too many permutations for this to be of much practical use. For $n=100$, how many permutations are there? There are 100 choices for the first city, and for each of those there are 99 choices for the second, and then 98 for the third, and so forth. So it seems like there are $100!$ (100 factorial). However, this is a bit overdone because recall that it does not matter which city we start at, so in fact the same tour is counted 100 times. But $99!$ is still big enough. It is greater than $10^{155}$, which is more than the number of atoms in our universe. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the simple algorithm is too slow. There are a few options to consider. One approach is to develop much more sophisticated algorithms. Throughout this course, you will learn many of the elements used by the best solver for the traveling salesman problem, a package called Concorde (which you can install on your iPhone - you are encouraged to do so). Concorde can easily solve inputs with 1000's or even 10,000 cities, but even that code has its limits. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach is to design simple algorithms that do not necessarily produce an optimal solution but instead produce good solutions. One natural one is called the *nearest neighbor rule*: start at one city and iteratively choose the next city as the one not yet visited that is currently nearest. There are a number of simple algorithms such as this one that will be demonstrated below."
