# The Traveling Salesman Problem

The traveling salesman problem is one of the most notorious optimization
problems.  The setting for the problem is as follows. A salesman starts at his
home and has a given set of cities to visit.  That is, if his home is in NY,
and he must visit Syracuse, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Detroit, and
Atlanta, then one possible solution is to go from NY to Chicago to San
Francisco to Los Angeles to Detroit to Atlanta to Syracuse, and then to return
home to NY.  Given that he is traveling to many cities and not staying over a
Saturday night, he only qualifies for the standard coach airfare between each
consecutive pair of cities that he visits.  He knows the airfare between each
pair of cities.  That is, in our example, he might be given the following table
of airfares:

Notice that the data contain a few irregularities (common to the airline
industry). The airfare from Syracuse to SF is \$445, but the airfare from
Syracuse to Atlanta is \$129 and the airfare from Atlanta to San Francisco is
\$165, for a total fare of \$294.  Unlike in this case, if the table of fares
has the property that the cheapest way to go between each pair of cities is to
take the non-stop flight, then the fares are said to satisfy the *it triangle
inequality*.  In cases such as the one above, they are said to *it violate*
the triangle inequality.  We shall assume that the salesman is pressed for
time, and always takes the non-stop flight between each of his stops on his
tour. Thus, the cost of the tour proposed above is:

$$135 + 180 + 39 + 195 + 135 + 160 + 202 = 1046.$$

Furthermore, if he were to go from NY to Syracuse to San Francisco to LA to
Chicago to Detroit to Atlanta to NY, then the cost would be

$$202+445 + 39 + 180 + 105 + 135 + 129 = 1235.$$

Clearly, the first tour is better.

The salesman would like to choose the order in which to
visit the cities so as to minimize the total cost of his trip.
For the data given above, is the first proposed tour the cheapest one?
The traveling salesman problem is an *it optimization problem*.
For any optimization problem, there is some notion of what kind of
input is expected.
For the traveling salesman problem,
the input consists of
a table of costs, such as the one given above, and it could
involve any number of cities. For any optimization problem,
there is also a notion of a *it feasible
solution*; that is, a possible answer (though not necessarily the
best answer). For this problem, a feasible solution is a tour that
visits all of the cities and returns to the starting point.
And finally,
there is the notion of an *it objection function*, the criterion
by which we choose which of the feasible solutions is the best one, the
*it optimal solution*.
In this case,
the objective function is the sum of the costs of
flying between each pair of cities
that occurs consecutively in the tour. In this case, our objective
function is to *it minimize* the value associated with the feasible
solution. In other problems, we will be dealing with *it maximization
problems*.
