    "# Modeling with the Traveling Salesman Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The traveling salesman problem is an important computational model for a variety of reasons. While the particular application of routing our poor salesman is valid enough, this does not really constitute a real-world application. However, it forms a  central component of more complicated models, such as routing a fleet of vehicles for pickups and deliveries, or more concretely, the sort of problem that a UPS depot might solve on a daily basis. It can also be used to model a number of problems that, at first glance, do not seem to be related.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we have already encountered one such example. We can model the problem of determining the order in which the radio telescope observes the set of stars being studied as a traveling salesman problem. The set of stars to be studied corresponds to the set of cities to be visited. The re-positioning times $\\mbox{Focus-time}[i,j]$ correspond directly to the costs $C[i,j]$. A feasible solution is again any permutation $\\pi$ of the stars, and the objective is to minimize the total re-positioning time for the telescope:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\mbox{Focus-time}[\\pi(i),\\pi(i+1)] + \\mbox{Focus-time}[\\pi(n),\\pi(1)].$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that this exactly captures what is needed in a 24-hour cycle of stellar observations. Hence, we could take our data for re-positioning the telescope, apply a standard software package for the traveling salesman problem (such as Concorde, which is the state of the art in this case), and be able to interpret the optimal solution for the corresponding traveling salesman input as an (optimal) solution to our telescope problem."

    "However, while modeling our telescope problem as a traveling salesman problem seems to make sense, and might work on some data sets, it also can fail miserably. Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are both minor and major reasons why this model does not perfectly represent our computational problem. One notable minor issue is that our model of the problem views the telescope positioning problem as a perfect cyclical 24-hour problem. Recall that we had one week of access to the telescope to make observations. At the start of the week, we are taking over from how it was used the previous week by another astronomer. However, this is a minor discrepancy and would have only a small effect on the selection of a regular daily pattern. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a more fundamental issue that concerns the statement: a feasible solution is again any permutation $\\pi$ of the stars. That is not true for our problem. The telescope cannot be positioned to observe a particular star next if it is no longer above the horizon. Thus, to carefully and correctly model the telescope problem, we actually need a more complicated model that takes into account not just \"travel times\" and \"waiting times\" (while the telescope is observing a given star) but also so-called time-windows for each star that indicate the period of time (within each 24-hour cycle) that it is observable by our telescope as part of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even more generally, this suggests a good rule of thumb - when trying to model a problem in a decision-making setting, start by considering the simplest model! But before attempting to use that model to make actual decisions, it is important to test it to be sure that the \"simplifying assumptions\" made along the way are indeed the kind that can be put aside with minimal effect. Hence, the overall design process of thinking about a model might be viewed as follows:"
