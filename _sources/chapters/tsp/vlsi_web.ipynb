    "Now we want to show that sometimes problems that are not quite the same can still be modeled as TSP, in that we can use Concorde (or any other general purpose solver for this problem) to find an optimal solution. Here is such an example which arises in the process of manufacturing VLSI computer chips (VLSI stands for \"very large-scale integration\", referring to the huge number of transistors that are integrated on a single chip). One step of this process can be viewed in the following simplified way: there is a square (a silicon wafer) on which one is going to etch a sequence of lines (electrical connections between different components of the chip). The machine doing the etching first moves to the correct position where the line starts and etches the particular line (as specified by the design) leaving it at a different point in the square. Then it must move to the correct position for the next line, and so forth. The lines may be etched in any order, but for each line, the etching must proceed in the specified direction (from the given starting point to the given ending point). The etching machine must start and end at the upper left-hand corner of the square (so as not to interfere with the square being put into and out of position for the etching). The VLSI etching optimization problem is to select an order for the lines to be etched so that as little time as possible is taken."

    "We will show that this problem can be viewed as a special case of the traveling salesman problem, or in other words, can be modeled as one. More precisely, we will show that given any input to the VLSI problem, we can construct an input for the traveling salesman problem with the property that an optimal solution for this new input (that is, the cheapest tour) can be interpreted as an optimal solution for the VLSI problem. Suppose that $N$ is a variable for the VLSI problem that specifies the number of lines in the input. From any given input to the VLSI problem with $N$ lines, we will construct a TSP input with $n=N+1$ cities; city 1 corresponds to the upper left-hand corner of this chip (at which the machine starts and ends its etching), and each of cities 2 through $N+1$ corresponds to one of the $N$ lines in the VLSI input.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next observation is that in performing the etching of the lines, the machine's time can be divided into two parts: the time actually etching the lines and the time moving the machine between lines when it is not actually etching. No matter what order in which the lines are etched, the time for the first part is the same. So, to minimize the total time for the machine, we should just minimize the total time that we are moving the machine without etching. If cities $i$ and $j$ both correspond to lines (so not special city 1) and the line corresponding to $j$ is etched immediately after the line corresponding $i$, then we spend the amount of time that it takes to move the machine from the endpoint of $i$'s line to the starting point of $j$'s line (while not etching). Furthermore, at the start, we move the machine from the upper left-hand corner to the starting point of the first line etched (while not etching). Finally, we move the machine from the ending point of the last line etched to the upper left-hand corner (while not etching). All of the periods in which the machine is not etching are considered in one of these cases. This motivates us to define the cost array as follows: let $C[i,j]$ be the time to move the machine from the ending point of $i$'s line to the starting point of $j$'s line, for each $i=2,\\ldots,N+1,\\ j=2,\\ldots,N+1$; let $C[1,j]$ be the time to move the machine from the upper left-hand corner to the starting point of $j$'s line, for each $j=2,\\ldots,N+1$; and let $C[i,1]$ be the time to move the machine from the ending point of $i$'s line to the upper left-hand corner, for each $i=2,\\ldots,N+1$."

    "This completes the explanation that the VLSI etching problem can be modeled by the traveling salesman problem. Why was this an interesting thing to do? The traveling salesman problem is an extremely well-studied problem. Thousands of man-hours have been invested into devising software packages that solve the traveling salesman problem. By modeling the new problem, the VLSI etching problem, as a traveling salesman problem, we can build off of that experience and just solve our inputs for the etching problem by using the best software for the traveling salesman problem that we can find. This is one of the main reasons why it is beneficial to identify important models, including the next few topics, in the first place so that we can then use our experience in solving these models to solve other problems as well."
