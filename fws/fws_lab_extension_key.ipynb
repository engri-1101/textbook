If a class has less than 6 (real) students assigned to it, it doesn't make sense for us to add dummy students until there are 6 students total, because that doesn't solve the problem of lack of interest.

(For instance, we want more first-choice than fifth-choice, so the cost of a first-choice edge is lower than the cost of a fifth-choice.)
