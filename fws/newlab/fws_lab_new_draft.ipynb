(For instance, we want more first-choice than fifth-choice, so the cost of a first-choice edge is lower than the cost of a fifth-choice.) Applying this to the dummy, setting the edge cost to an enormous number like 100,000 essentially discourages the solver from ever choosing a dummy edge over a real student edge unless absolutely necessary to get a feasible solution. \n",
