    "## Review\n",
    "Recall, linear programs (LPs) have three main components: decision variables, constraints, and an objective function. The goal of linear programming is to find a **feasible solution** (a solution satisfying every constraint) with the best objective value. The set of feasible solutions form a **feasible region**. In lecture, we learned about isoprofit lines. For every objective value, we can define an isoprofit line. Isoprofit lines have the property that two solutions on the same line have the same objective value and all isoprofit lines are parallel. \n",
