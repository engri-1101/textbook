    "**Brief description:** If you recall pre-enroll, there was a separate ballot you completed by listing your top 5 picks for FWS that semester. You were later notified which class you got placed into, probably hoping it was your first choice. By now, this should not seem like magic; problems like these often enlist help from Operations Research especially as the scale increases.
