Since you can only use the edges shown in the graph, you must choose a subgraph of the given graph, or in other words, a subset of the possible edges. Every location must be serviced which means that the subgraph must be spanning. You should be able to get to any location from any other location. This means the subgraph should be connected. Because you are trying to minimize cost, the subgraph should also be minimal, meaning that you cannot remove any of the edges while maintaining the other necessary properties. A minimal connected spanning subgraph is called a spanning tree. There are many other ways of defining trees.

A cluster is a subset of the data so that the data points in the subset are similar to each other, and different from data points not in the cluster. CLustering is one of the most important applications of modern computing. It is, for example, a vital technique for machine learning. Suppose you are in the marketing department of a food delivery firm, and you want to tailor your advertisements so you can appeal to different customers in relevant ways. You can use clustering methods to divide your customer base into groups based on some key characteristics, and then you can choose adverisements that are best for each group. Then, for any given customer, the algorithm can identify which group the customer falls in, and show them the corresponding advertisemments. This is a very major application of clustering, known as market segmentation. We can look at a very simple example to illustrate this process.\n",

For larger data sets in many dimensions, it may be impossible to visualize the data at all. In that case, these clusters can also be identified algorithmically, using the same techniques we used to find MSTs. We will use Kruskal's algorithm. In every step of Kruskal's algorithm we add the shortest edge possible. Since the edge is chosen so that it does not form a cycle, each added edge connects two previously unconnected components of the graph. At the end of the last step, the whole graph is connected, so right before the second-last step, the graph is divided into three components. Since the edges we added were connecting parts that were closest to each other, the three components at the end are also going to be the clusters. Below, the points are shown as a graph, with the approximate distances between some pairs of nodes shown as weighted edges. A computer would run this algorithm on the graph with all nodes connected to each other, but for better visualization only a subset of the edges are shown.
