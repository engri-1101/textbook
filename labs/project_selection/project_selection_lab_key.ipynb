    "## Project Selection Problem\n",
    "Here we provide a walkthrough of the Tool Selection problem (sometimes known as the Tool Selection problem), which we will then cleverly reduce to a min-cut instance where the cut defines the optimal set of projects we want to select. This problem is often used to help companies determine which projects they should take on in order to maximize their total profit given that they know the costs and rewards of completing each project, and there are overlapping costs between some of the projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is as follows: suppose you have a set of projects $p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$ and a set of tools $t_1, t_2, ..., t_m$. Each project $p_i$ has with it an associated reward/benefit for completing it $b_i$ and a set of tools that it depends on in order to be completed $D_i$. Each tool $t_j$ has an associated cost for acquiring it $c_j$, but once acquired, can be used an infinite amount of times. We can imagine the tools, for example, to be various software that we need to purchase licenses for to be used in certain projects. Let's denote the set of projects we end up taking as $P$ and the set of tools we buy as $T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal here is that we want to maximize the profit that we earn. That is, we want to maximize the total benefit we get from the projects we take minus the total cost we have to endure in order to do those projects. Here's what that looks like if we turn it into an objective function: *maximize* $\\sum_{p_i \\in P}^{} b_i - \\sum_{t_i \\in T}^{} c_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon first glance, you might think \"well, this is a maximization problem so if I were to turn it into some instance of a network flow problem, I would probably try max flow first.\" Take a moment to think about how you might model that... tricky right? Unfortunately for us, even though the objective function the problem defines for us seems to neatly fit into a max-flow model, there actually isn't any immediately clear way to model it in that way. So, we need to make a clever change to our objective function to expand the options we have for modeling this problem, and we'll do so by turning it into a minimization function."

Similarly, since the sink node is always not in the cut, if we use any tool, its connecting edge to $t$ will contribute as well. Let's visualize the network so far after adding $s$ and $t$:\n",

Let's focus on how to tie the network together with edges between project and tool nodes. We need some way to encode the dependencies between projects and the tools they require. In the min-cut model, this means that if project 1 depends on tools A and B, we need a way to ensure that if we include project 1 in the cut, we must also include tools A and B; they cannot be on opposite sides of the cut. A clever way to encode this is using infinite-capacity edges, a very powerful modeling tool.
