    "In ENGRI 1101, labs will be done through *Jupyter Notebooks*.  The name \"Jupyter Notebook\" tries to convey what these are: *notebooks* that contain snippets of various items, including text, pictures,  mathematical equations, and Python code. This handout is meant to be viewed as a Jupyter Notebook (more details below), in which case it will be interactive: you'll be able to run code demos, double-click blocks of text to make edits, modify and write code, and type answers to questions.  However, there is also a PDF version of this notebook meant as a reference handout.  If you're viewing the PDF version, you will not be able to interact with it.  Instead, in the PDF version you will see code appear in gray boxes showing both the input and the output.  \n",

However, 1101 is neither a programming class nor does it have programming as a prerequisite!

A Jupyter notebook consists of cells of two main types: text cells (written using raw text and Markdown for formatting) and Code.

Right now, you are seeing the Markdown text after it is already compiled. Double-click the bold text **CLICK HERE** to see the Markdown before it is compiled (assuming you're viewing this handout as a Jupyter notebook and not a PDF).  When you double click, you should see two asterisks (\\*\\*) flanking each side of the bold text; those double-asterisks signify that you want bold text in Markdown.  To go back to the compiled version of this text (and see all the formatting), press either CTRL+Enter (which  compiles the cell) or Shift+Enter (which compiles this cell and moves to the next).\n",

In high school, you generally think of a variable as something you solve for.  In Python, you should think of a variable as a labeled envelope that stores data.  In Python syntax, we use the equals sign to assign data to a variable.  Hence, the code below effectively creates an envelope `x` containing the data `1101`.  When we ask Python to `print(x)`, Python prints the corresponding data in that envelope (`1101`).\n",
