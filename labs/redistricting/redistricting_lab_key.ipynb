    "Every 10 years in the US, following the census, the process of *reapportionment* determines how the 435 representatives in the House of Representatives will be distributed among the 50 states. Depending on population shifts, a state may lose or gain a representative. Each state is divided in to electoral districts; one for each representative. Hence, after reapportionment, states *redistrict* to redraw the electoral district boundaries. These boundaries are drawn subject to a few federal constraints:\n",

    "- Districts must have roughly the same population (total state population / number of representatives).\n",

    "You may have noticed that there is no restriction on packing or cracking political parties. These two strategies are common in a phenomenon known as *gerrymandering*.
