    "**Brief description:** Finding an optimal solution to a Traveling Salesman Problem, and proving that it is, in fact, an optimal solution, is a difficult task. In practice, when a feasible solution to a difficult problem needs to be provided quickly, one often resorts to using heuristics, i.e., procedures for generating feasible solutions, or improving existing ones, that can be executed quickly and, hopefully, produce a pretty good result. In this lab we will consider several such heuristic procedures for the TSP.\n",
