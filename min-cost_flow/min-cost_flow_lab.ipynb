    "**Review:** Recall the min-cost flow problem. For our input, we have a directed graph $G = (N,A)$. For each arc $(i,j) \\in A$, we have a per-unit cost $c(i,j)$ and capacity $u(i,j)$. For each node $i \\in N$, we have a demand / supply $b(i)$. If $b(i) > 0$, we have supply at node $i$. If $b(i) < 0$, we have demand at node $i$. Our goal is to distribute the supply to the demand nodes at minimal cost. A solution to the min-cost problem can be described by giving a flow $f(i,j)$ for every arc $(i,j) \\in A$. The objective value of a solution is given by $\\sum_{(i,j) \\in A} c(i,j)*f(i,j)$."
