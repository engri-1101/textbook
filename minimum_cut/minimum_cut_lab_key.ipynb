    "Hopefully in the previous question, you wrote something that assigns capacities depending on whether we're looking at a project or a tool. This suggests that in our network, we probably want to at least have a node for each project and each tool (along with a source and a sink which we'll add toward the end). Let's use that idea and experiment with the different ways we could assign capacities since we could either assign it to incoming, outgoing, or both incoming and outgoing edges.\n",

    "Great! If you interpreted the cut correctly, you'll have found that this assignment of edge capacities uses the costs of tools we need and benefits of projects we don't take exactly as we wanted from our objective function. Here, projects and tools we use are inside the cut, and the capacity of the cut reflects benefits of projects we left out (essentially opportunity costs of not taking on a project) and costs of tools we needed to use. \n",

    "Since all the projects now have incoming edges, it seems likely these incoming edges could all originate from the same source and since all the tool nodes now have outgoing edges, it's likely they could all end at the same sink node. Another point of intuition is that since the source is always on the s-side of the cut, by having the source connect to each project node, if a project is not in the cut, then we know its connecting edge from $s$ will contribute to the cut capacity. Similarly, since the sink node is always not in the cut, if we use any tool, its connecting edge to $t$ will contribute as well. Let's visualize the network so far after adding $s$ and $t$:\n",

    "It looks somewhat similar to our bipartite matching graph since we can divide the project and tool nodes quite well, but there is a bit more going on here. Let's focus on how to tie the network together with edges between project and tool nodes. We need some way to encode the dependencies between projects and the tools they require. In the min-cut model, this means that if project 1 depends on tools A and B, we need a way to ensure that if we include project 1 in the cut, we must also include tools A and B; they cannot be on opposite sides of the cut. A clever way to encode this is using infinite-capacity edges, a very powerful modeling tool. Here, since we want some relationship between projects and tools, we'll have these edges be between the two layers of nodes."
