# Algorithm

Next we need an algorithm to solve this mathematical model. In this case,
we will be able to give a very simple algorithm that for any input,
finds an optimal solution. 
First think about finding a node that is closest to the source $s$.
In some trivial sense, $s$ is the closest node to itself, so
we will set ${\sf Closest}(1)=s$.
Now we wish to find some other node $i$ for which the shortest path
from $s$ to $i$ is as short as possible.  We shall call this node
${\sf Closest}(2)$.
Clearly, there might be 
several nodes that are all the same distance from $s$, but for at least
one of these nodes $i$ 
there is an arc $(s,i)$, since if you
can reach $i$ from $s$ only by passing through some other node
along the way, that other node
must be at least as close to $s$ as $i$.
(Would this still be true if an arc could have a negative length?)
So ${\sf Closest}(2)$ can be identified by considering all arcs of
the form $(s,i)$;
let $(s,i^*)$ be the arc leaving $s$ that is shortest.
Then 
${\sf Closest}(2) = i^*$, and the shortest path from $s$ to $i^*$ consists
of the single arc $(s,i^*)$.
Next consider identifying the node that is next closest to $s$
(counting ties, so it might be just  as close as 
${\sf Closest}(2)$). The shortest path might be just one arc from $s$, or
else it might first pass through ${\sf Closest}(2)$ and then continue
on to it. By considering all of the paths of this form, we can identify
the next closest node, ${\sf Closest}(3)$. We can continue in this way
until we have assigned each node to be ${\sf Closest}(j)$ for some $j=1,\ldots,n$.
At each stage, we know that the shortest path to ${\sf Closest}(j)$ must
consist of the shortest path to ${\sf Closest}(i)$, for some $i=1,\ldots,j-1$,
and then one arc from ${\sf Closest}(i)$ to ${\sf Closest}(j)$.

We will now describe the algorithm
to compute the shortest path from $s$ to each other node in the graph
in a more formal way. The fact that the algorithm always finds the
correct solution is a direct consequence of the previous discussion.
Since this algorithm was first proposed by E. Dijkstra, it is commonly
called *Dijkstra's algorithm*. 

```{admonition} Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm

**Initialization:** Set ${\sf Label}(s)\leftarrow 0$, and 
${\sf Label}(i)\leftarrow  + \infty$ for all other nodes $i$ in $N$. 
Set $j\leftarrow 0$.\
Let ${\sf Prev}(i)$ be undefined for each node $i$ in $N$; all 
nodes are unmarked.

**Loop:** Until all nodes are marked with a $*$ do the 
following:
- Set $j\leftarrow j+1$;
- Among all unmarked nodes, select a node $i$ for which 
the label is minimum;
- Mark node $i$ with a $*$; Set ${\sf Closest}(j)\leftarrow i$;
- For each arc of the form $(i,j)$, or in other words, for each arc 
leaving node $i$,
compare ${\sf Label}(j)$ with ${\sf Label}(i)+ \ell(i,j)$; if the latter is smaller,
then set ${\sf Label}(j) \leftarrow  {\sf Label}(i) + \ell(i,j)$, and set ${\sf Prev}(j)\leftarrow i$.\
(Note: in fact, it suffices to consider all arcs leaving $i$ that go
to unmarked nodes $j$.)
  ```

It is not clear that, when this algorithm finishes, you have
computed any path from $s$ to each other node, let alone a shortest path
for each of these nodes. 
Let us first run Dijkstra's algorithm on the above example, where
node 1 is the specified source.

```{attention} Figure: A graph with arc lengths should be here (note that in the tex file, it is much earlier)
```


**Initialization:**

|Node | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|----|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|${\sf Label}$| $0$ | $+\infty $ | $+\infty $ | $+\infty $ | $+\infty $| $+\infty $|
|${\sf Prev}$|  -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
||

Clearly, node 1 is the one to be marked, that is, $i=1$. 
There are two arcs leaving
node 1: $(1,2)$ and $(1,3)$. Since ${\sf Label}(2)=+\infty$, ${\sf Label}(1)=0$,
and $\ell(1,2)=6$, it follows that we should update ${\sf Label}(2)=6$
and ${\sf Prev}(2)=1$. This can be interpreted as follows: we have found
a shorter path to node 2; take the shortest path to node 1 (which is
no path at all) and then take arc $(1,2)$. Since the node previous to
2 in this path is node 1, we have set ${\sf Prev}(2)=1$. Similarly, we
set ${\sf Label}(3)=2$, and ${\sf Prev}(3)=1$. 

**After the first iteration of the main loop:**

|Node | 1$^*$ | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|----|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|${\sf Label}$| $0$ | $6$ | $2$ | $+\infty $ | $+\infty $| $+\infty $|
|${\sf Prev}$|  -- | 1 | 1 | -- | -- | -- |
||

Now node 3 is the next one to be marked. There are arcs leaving 3 to nodes
2 and 5. For the first of these, ${\sf Label}(2)=6$ whereas ${\sf Label}(3)+\ell(3,2)=
2+5=7$, and so we leave ${\sf Label}(2)$ unchanged. We did not find an improved
path to node 2. For node 5, we set ${\sf Label}(5)=3$ and ${\sf Prev}(5)=3$. As above,
this means that the best path we have found from 1 to 5 consists of taking
the best path that we have found from 1 to 3 (which consists of just the
arc $(1,3)$) and then arc $(3,5)$.

**After the second iteration of the main loop:**

|Node | 1$^*$ | 2 | 3$^*$ | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|----|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|${\sf Label}$| $0$ | $6$ | $2$ | $+\infty$ | $3$| $+\infty $|
|${\sf Prev}$|  -- | 1 | 1 | -- | 3 | -- |
||

Now node 5 is the next node to be marked. There are two arcs leaving
node 5, to nodes 2 and 6. In the former case, we discover a path of
length 3+1=4 to node 2, 
and so we set ${\sf Label}(2)=4$ and ${\sf Prev}(2)=5$. For the latter,
we set ${\sf Label}(6)=3+2=5$, and ${\sf Prev}(6)=5$.

**After the third iteration of the main loop:**

|Node | 1$^*$ | 2 | 3$^*$ | 4 | 5$^*$ | 6 |
|----|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|${\sf Label}$| $0$ | $4$ | $2$ | $+\infty $ | $3$| $5$|
|${\sf Prev}$|  -- | 5 | 1 | -- | 3 | 5 |
||

Check that you get the results tabulated below for the remainder of the
execution of the algorithm on this graph. The only point to
mention is that in processing the arcs leaving node 2 (the next
marked node) we need only consider the arc $(2,4)$, since the arc $(2,3)$
leads to a node that is already marked.

**After the fourth iteration of the main loop:**

|Node | 1$^*$ | 2$^*$ | 3$^*$ | 4 | 5$^*$ | 6 |
|----|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|${\sf Label}$| $0$ | $4$ | $2$ | $7$ | $3$| $5$|
|${\sf Prev}$|  -- | 5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 |
||

**After the fifth iteration of the main loop:**

|Node | 1$^*$ | 2$^*$ | 3$^*$ | 4 | 5$^*$ | 6$^*$ |
|----|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|${\sf Label}$| $0$ | $4$ | $2$ | $7$ | $3$| $5$|
|${\sf Prev}$|  -- | 5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 |
||

**And finally, after the sixth iteration of the main loop:**

|Node | 1$^*$ | 2$^*$ | 3$^*$ | 4$^*$ | 5$^*$ | 6$^*$ |
|----|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|${\sf Label}$| $0$ | $4$ | $2$ | $7$ | $3$| $5$|
|${\sf Prev}$|  -- | 5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 |
||

By now it should be clear how to deduce the shortest paths
from this information. Take node 4, for example. We get there
by coming from ${\sf Prev}(4)=2$. But how do we get to node 2? From
node ${\sf Prev}(2)=5$. And we get to node 5 from node ${\sf Prev}(5)=3$.
And we get to node 3 from node ${\sf Prev}(3)=1$, which is the source.
(We can detect that we have traced back to the source by the fact
that its ${\sf Prev}(\cdot)$ value is still  undefined. So the shortest
path from node 1 to node 4 is $(1,3), (3,5), (5,2), (2, 4)$.

---

While we can perform this tracing-back each time we wish
to determine a shortest path, we can also give a nice way to
concisely describe all of the shortest paths. For each node $i$
that is not the source, highlight the arc from ${\sf Prev}(i)$ to $i$.
This is done for our example in the figure below.


```{attention} Figure: Shortest path tree should be here
```

This collection of arcs is called the *shortest path tree*. With an
active imagination (and holding this piece of paper sideways),
you can think of this as a tree growing up from the source node.
Its importance should be clear. For each node $i$ we have highlighted
the shortest path from 1 to $i$. 

```{note}
The solution to the shortest path problem can be summarized by a *shortest path tree*. The unique path from $s$ to $i$ in this tree is exactly the shortest path from $s$ to $i$ in the input graph, for every node $i\in N$.
