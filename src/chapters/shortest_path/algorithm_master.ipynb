    "# Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we need an algorithm to solve this mathematical model. In this case, we will be able to give a very simple algorithm that for any input, finds an optimal solution. First think about finding a node that is closest to the source $s$. In some trivial sense, $s$ is the closest node to itself, so we will set $\\text{Closest}(1)=s$. Now we wish to find some other node $i$ for which the shortest path from $s$ to $i$ is as short as possible.  We shall call this node $\\text{Closest}(2)$. Clearly, there might be several nodes that are all the same distance from $s$, but for at least one of these nodes $i$, there is an arc $(s,i)$ since if you can reach $i$ from $s$ only by passing through some other node along the way, that other node must be at least as close to $s$ as $i$. (Would this still be true if an arc could have a negative length?) So $\\text{Closest}(2)$ can be identified by considering all arcs of the form $(s,i)$; let $(s,i^*)$ be the arc leaving $s$ that is shortest. Then $\\text{Closest}(2) = i^*$, and the shortest path from $s$ to $i^*$ consists of the single arc $(s,i^*)$. Next consider finding the node that is next closest to $s$ (counting ties, so it might be just as close as $\\text{Closest}(2)$). The shortest path might be just one arc from $s$, or it might first pass through $\\text{Closest}(2)$ before reaching the node. By considering all of the paths of this form, we can identify the next closest node, $\\text{Closest}(3)$. We can continue in this way until we have assigned each node to be $\\text{Closest}(j)$ for some $j=1,\\ldots,n$. At each stage, we know that the shortest path to $\\text{Closest}(j)$ must consist of the shortest path to $\\text{Closest}(i)$, for some $i=1,\\ldots,j-1$, and then one arc from $\\text{Closest}(i)$ to $\\text{Closest}(j)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now describe the algorithm to compute the shortest path from $s$ to each other node in the graph in a more formal way. The fact that the algorithm always finds the correct solution is a direct consequence of the previous discussion. Since this algorithm was first proposed by E. Dijkstra, it is commonly called *Dijkstra's algorithm*."
