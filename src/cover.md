# Data Science and Decision Making: An Elementary Introduction to Modeling and Optimization

Introduction to the problems and methods of operations research and information
engineering focusing on problem areas (including inventory, network design, and
resource allocation), the situations in which these problems arise, and several
standard solution techniques. In the computational laboratory, students
encounter problem simulations and use some standard commercial software
packages.
