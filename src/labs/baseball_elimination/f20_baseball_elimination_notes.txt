This lab was pretty solid for the most part although many students really struggled with Q18 + 19. These questions asked students to consider if an infinite capacity min-cut was possible in a max flow formulation for the baseball elimination problem. Most of the confusion with this question stemmed from students thinking the cut capacity was computed bu summing edge flows and not the edge capacities. Maybe there should be a review about this fact before lab? The questions for this section could also be broken up to be more guiding.
