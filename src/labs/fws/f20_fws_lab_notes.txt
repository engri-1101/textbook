This was a pretty quick lab. Need to make it more clear that this is not a balanced transportation problem since the supply at the dummy node is infinite. (We are not adding the dummy to make it balanced, we are adding it to make sure the demand at every class node is met). Furthermore, most questions came about from students using 2 instead of csize when writing the constraint or using for x in CLASSES when x was also the variable used for the decision variables.
