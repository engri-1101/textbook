Students had the option to complete this lab on their own. It was the
last lab of the semester. I had few students come to the optional lab
section. Of those that did, most had issues understanding complementary
slackness (although we did not use this name in the lab). I think the 
strategy of the computer goalie in the penalty kick game needs to be
improved. When using the optimal kicker strategy, the goalie ends up 
staying middle the entire time when it should go left ~10% of the time.
