    "\n",
    "  <p>In soccer (or football), a team may be awarded a <i>penalty kick</i> if they are fouled by the other team within a certain area. When a team is awarded a penalty kick, they select a player (the <i>kicker</i>) to attempt to kick a single goal, engaging in a 2-person, 0-sum game against the opposing team's goal keeper (their <i>keeper</i> for short): The kicker aims to kick the ball into the goal, while the keeper tries to block it.  Because the ball only takes about 3-tenths of a second to reach the goal, the keeper must decide how to move to try and block the kick before the kicker actually kicks!  Thus, both the kicker's and keeper's actions are predetermined.</p>\n",

    "  <ul>\n",
    "    <li>You will play multiple iterations as the kickers to create a total score that you wish to maximize.</li>\n",
    "    <li>For each iteration, you will select a <b>left or right -footed kicker</b>. The keeper will be informed of your choice.</li>\n",
    "    <li>You and the keeper will each commit to a strategy: the kicker will kick to the <b>left, middle, or right</b> of the goal, and the keeper will dive to the <b>left, middle, or right</b>. We will represent this pair of decisions as (kicker direction, keeper direction)</li> \n",
    "    <li>The keeper's action, the kicker's footedness, and their kick direction determine the goal scoring probability according to Table 1. We can see, for instance, that a right-footed kicker does best when they kick right and the keeper dives in the opposite direction (scoring 95% of the time). However, if they kick right and the keeper properly anticipates this, they only score 70% of the time.</li>\n",
