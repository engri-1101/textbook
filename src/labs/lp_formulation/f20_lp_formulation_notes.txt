This lab used OR-Tools. Some students (mainly Windows users)
had issues because they did not have Visual Studio 2019
installed. OR-Tools requirements can be found here:

Students did not have much trouble with part 1 but some
stuggled with the LP formulation from scratch in part 2.
Similarly, some students had issues with the LP formulation
in the review sheet for the semi-final. However, students
did very well on the LP formulation question on the
semi-final overall!
