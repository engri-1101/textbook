This lab was pretty smooth. At first, we just planned to do the
bonus part at the end but at the last moment, we choose to run
the whole lab. A few students had issues writing the constraint
in the OR-Tools model for the maximum independent set. I think
this stemmed from not quite understanding how the nodes and edges
of the graph were related to the seat packing.
