    "As campuses reopen for the fall semester, implementing social distancing measures is a top priority. Students need to maintain a 6 foot distance in lecture halls which means the seating capacity will drop. This is an issue for large and small classes when it comes to room assignments. For ENGRI 1101, we want to enable as many students as possible to attend in-person labs so that they can get immediate help or use the lab computers.  "
