Many students had trouble with the formulation for the probelm (which I agree is kind of counter-intuitive). Maybe we could divide up some of these questions to guide students through the formulation better. Furhtermore, this was the first lab where you had to adjust previously run cells and then re-run them. Students were pretty accustomed to running the notebook straight through at this point so this caused issues. We should just rewrite the model every time they make a change to it or do an equivalent change making it possible to run the notebok the whole way through.

(2-1-2021) The issue arising from adjusting and running previously run cells was addressed in the same manor as it was in subsequent labs. Both the key and lab file were updated. The _colab file was not updated.
